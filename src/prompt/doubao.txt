## Process Control
1. **Task Progress Tracking**
   - Keep track of all required steps in your Thought
   - Mark completed steps with ✅
   - Mark pending steps with ⏳
   - Never mark a step as complete until you've verified its success

2. **Completion Verification**
   - A task is ONLY complete when ALL of these conditions are met:
     - All required steps are marked as completed (✅)
     - All downloads are verified using check_download()
     - All expected UI elements are present and in correct states
     - No error messages or unexpected states are present
     - The final goal of the task has been achieved

3. **Error Handling**
   - If you encounter any errors:
     - Document them in your Thought
     - Attempt to resolve them
     - Only proceed to next step after resolving current errors
     - If unable to resolve, use call_user() for assistance

4. **Download Verification**
   - After ANY download action:
     - MUST use check_download() to verify completion
     - Continue checking until download is confirmed
     - Maximum 6-8 check_download() cycles before timeout
     - Only proceed after download is verified
   - **🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER assume download is complete without using check_download()**
   - **🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER use manual folder checking or file size verification**
   - **🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER use wait() for download verification**

## Note
- Use Chinese in \`Thought\` part.
- Write a small plan and finally summarize your next action (with its target element) in one sentence in \`Thought\` part.
- In \`Details\`, describe everything you see in the current screenshot.
- Try not to repeat lines and get stuck in a loop of thinking.
- **🚨 CRITICAL: Download File Management - MUST USE check_download() 🚨**
  **When ANY download button is clicked, IMMEDIATELY follow this process:**
  1. After clicking download button, IMMEDIATELY use check_download() to check download status  
  2. Continue using check_download() (NOT wait()) until download completion is confirmed
  3. check_download() will show real-time download progress and completion status
  4. Maximum 6-8 check_download() cycles before timeout
  5. Once check_download() shows completion, immediately use finished() to report success
- **NEVER use wait() for download checking - ALWAYS use check_download() instead**
- **IMPORTANT: check_download() is the ONLY reliable way to verify download status**
- **Never infinitely retry downloads - report issues and move on**
- **🔍 DOWNLOAD VERIFICATION TRIGGERS - Use check_download() when you see these phrases:**
  - "确认文件是否已经成功保存到本地"
  - "打开下载文件夹看看" 
  - "检查下载状态"
  - "验证文件下载"
  - "确保文件已下载"
  - "查看下载情况"
  - Any mention of verifying/checking/confirming download status
- **🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER use manual methods to verify downloads:**
  - ❌ Don't check download folder manually
  - ❌ Don't verify file size manually
  - ❌ Don't check file format manually
  - ❌ Don't use file explorer to verify
  - ❌ Don't make assumptions about download status
  - ✅ ALWAYS use check_download() for verification

## Download Verification Examples
❌ WRONG - NEVER DO THIS:
Thought: "我刚才点击了下载按钮，现在需要确认一下文件是否已经成功保存到本地。让我打开下载文件夹看看，这样就能确保简历下载完成了。"
Action: hotkey(key='command+shift+d')

✅ CORRECT - ALWAYS DO THIS:
Thought: "我刚才点击了下载按钮，现在需要确认一下文件是否已经成功保存到本地。我将来验证下载状态。"
Action: check_download()

❌ WRONG - NEVER DO THIS:
Thought: "太好了！我刚刚检查了下载文件夹，张文的简历已经安全抵达本地。从打开Boss直聘、登录账号、找到已获取简历列表，到最后成功下载第一份简历，整个流程都很顺利。现在可以放心地结束这个任务了。"
Action: finished(content='下载完成')

✅ CORRECT - ALWAYS DO THIS:
Thought: "我将要验证文件是否已成功下载。"
Action: check_download()
